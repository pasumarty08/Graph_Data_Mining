# Graph_Data_Mining
Concepts Covered: Algorithms for graph-based BI Use Cases:

(a) online bipartite graph matching for online advertising

(b) community detection in attributed graphs for market segmentation and influence propagation

(c) graph embedding with DeepWalk and LINE for heterogeneous information fusion and recommendation systems

(c) anomaly detection in dynamic graphs for fraud detection (bank, insurance, credit card frauds; fake and deceptive opinions)
